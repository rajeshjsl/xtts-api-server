directory structure below:-

  xtts-server volume on host is mapped to /app/xtts-server inside container
                                       which contains these three folders
                                          -  output
                                          -  speakers
                                          -  models

  create a new folder name sample_male_folder and place sample_male.wav inside it
  the speaker_wav becomes the folder name 

  /tts_to_audio
  "text" : test"
  "language" : "en"
  "speaker_wav" : "sample_male_folder"

  the folder name becomes the "speaker_wav" regardless of the file names inside it.

  the api supports switching models (which is v2.0.2 by default, you'll need to download the files from https://huggingface.co/coqui/XTTS-v2/tree/v2.0.2  (currently it auto downloads for 2.0.2 since model source is set to local in dockerfile)
  swagger api is at /docs and it has many options to get speakers list, set models, set model parameters, etc. refer it.
